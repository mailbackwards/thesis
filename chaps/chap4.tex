\chapter{Technologies and Tools}

% Here I will propose a solution; first by analyzing the data structure of some newsroom APIs, then suggesting a way to link them.

% Some tools that are cool: FOLD, Timelines, Evernote Context, Media in Context apps, Chorus, etc.

% Big theme: use a "push" rather than "pull" method to enliven the archive. The Times Report: you shouldn't have to do deep searches to find relevant stories, new or old. Younger audiences: "if something is important, it will find me" (Inno Report p. 39). Also: "we still ask too much of readers â€” they must navigate a website and apps that are modeled on our print structure." (p. 26)
