\chapter{Link Analysis}

% This section will have quantitative analysis of inlinking vs. outlinking, both historical and my own research.
% Maybe call out 1-2 particular cases (NYT? Guardian? etc.) to see how they're linking

The last chapter dealt with how publishers think about their archives and linking. This section focuses instead on what they're \emph{already doing} through quantitative link analysis. It will combine historic news network analyses and a study that I performed with the help of Media Cloud.

\section{Mapping Links}

% Some theory about how to do it. Talk to CÃ©sar? Reference De Maeyer's piece about it.
% Mapping, but also visualizing
% End by explaining my methodology

\section{Legacy media and links}

\section{Digital media and links}

\section{Honing in a couple topics (``controversies'')}

% Could combine Media Cloud aggregate ``big data'' view with Times Newswire API (e.g. 1 month, ~9k stories) for deeper view into one publication. Deeper view could be a) anchor text, b) where the link is in relation to the top of the article, named entities, etc.

\section{Automated NER and linked data potential}

% Can we get richer info automatically out of the entities referenced in newsrooms?
